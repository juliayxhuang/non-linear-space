        big fur boots
        clean floors no salt a guy sleeping his bag beside him
        poem on the radio maps and beats
        have no fear the bull is here
        a group of three sit spaced out
        empty seats cleaner than udu
        black boots black nikes 
        quiet
        asking for a dollar red water bottle
        eyes down scrolling typing texting
        b brighton beach
        muffled announcements 
        i can’t hear
        glasses on still sleeping
        wrappers on the ground 
        basketball tags tiles
         <a id="green" href="line-2.html">green</a>
        pillars 
        there’s a duo in the trio long hair ring on middle finger
        ring on her ring finger
        flash of red and blue red again 
        orange plastic my sock is falling off
        glasses speaking earbud airpods looking around about the get off the train
        ring bell dangling from the ceiling 
        go on… double dip! what does that mean
        slowing down 
        this is
