    <p id="text">tire screeching guy texting in front 
    uncrosses his legs
    next stop is astor place locks stops
    he’s zooming in on google maps
    puddle of snapple on the floor
    ding
    this is astor place
    train slows down
    doors open 
    two people walk in another two
    stand clear of the closing doors please
    doors stutter
    <a href="line-3.html">ding</a>

    he’s laughing
    grabbing onto the pole beside me
    glove off scrolling on the phone
    glove on grabbing the pole
    leaning on the bars
    iphone blue
    iphone black
    otterbox 
    arriving at the station
    humming surprisingly quiet
    walks in with baggy pants headphones on
    beats is that matthew
    looks like clown feet
    big parkas
    furry hoods
    curly hair and pink backpacks
    please don’t skip my stop
    waiting at the door
